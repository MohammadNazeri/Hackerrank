1. Variables, Functions, Methods:
  Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case). For example: my_variable, calculate_area(), process_data(), etc.

2. Constants:
  Use all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words for constants. For example: MAX_VALUE, PI, DEFAULT_THRESHOLD, etc.

3. Classes:
  Use CamelCase (also known as CapitalizedWords) for class names. For example: MyClass, BankAccount, CarModel, etc.

4. Private Variables and Methods:
  For private variables and methods, use a single leading underscore. For example: _private_variable, _private_method().

5. Modules:
  Use short, lowercase names for modules. Avoid using underscores in module names if possible. For example: math, random, os, etc.

6. Packages:
  Use short, lowercase names for packages. Preferably without underscores. For example: numpy, pandas, requests, etc.

7. Function and Variable Naming Conventions:
  Descriptive names: Use meaningful and descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the function or variable.
  Use verbs for function names: Function names should typically describe actions using verbs when appropriate (e.g., calculate, process, generate, create, etc.).
  Use nouns for variable names: Variable names should typically be nouns and reflect the data they hold or represent.

8. Indentation and Spacing:
  Use 4 spaces for indentation.
  Use spaces around operators (=, +, -, etc.) for better readability.
  Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters (though this is not a strict requirement).

9. Comments and Documentation:
  Write clear and concise comments explaining complex code or adding context to the code.
  Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules.

Other Recommendations:
  Avoid using single-character names, except for simple loop variables (i, j, k).
  Be consistent within your codebase and follow the conventions used in existing code or projects you are contributing to.
